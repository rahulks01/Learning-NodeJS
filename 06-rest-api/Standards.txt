// RESTful API

1. Client - Server Architecture
    The idea is that the client and the server should not be 
    dependent on each other each of them should act as a single entity.
    We should always try to send the response from the server in the
    JSON format.

2. Always respect all HTTP methods
    GET    POST    PUT    PATCH    DELETE
    GET /user -> Read user's data and return data
    POST /user -> Handle new user's creation
    PATCH /user -> Update the user
    .
    .
    
    POST /update-user -> user update  (X)
    POST /delete-user -> delete user  (X)
